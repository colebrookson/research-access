## Notes From Meeting with Madeleine Thompson (WCS)

### Data stuff

- intranet site 
- she could copy the contents and give that to us (no ISSNs, just journal name) 
- it's 90% accurate, in some cases, we've added titles that aren't in the intranet package 
- as a last resort, she could give us a word doc with titles and coverage  

### Other questions

- International Environmental libraries consortium (WCS is a part of it, WWF is a part of it, WRI, NRDC, etc) 
- benefit of this consortium is they go in on journal packages together, 20 orgs a part of it, and 10 of them who keep in touch regularly, they ask each other questions, "who is assigning ISBNs etc", things like that 
- they do some inter-library loaning between each other
- even w/in the IELC group, it varies between them in terms of folks who are actually *in* libraries and have librarians, so for example, TNC has a research scientist in charge of their library resources 
- WWF and WCS are the biggest in terms of packages 
- IELC isn't just north america, there are some from the UK 
- no collaborations between universities and NGOs who she knows of, but it could be useful
