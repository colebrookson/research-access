# Methods on How Institutions were Classified and Accessed

## Universities

### MSIs

Minority serving institutions (MSIs) were identified via Rutgers University's [Centre for MSIs](https://cmsi.gse.rutgers.edu/) which lists the institutions from 2020 that qualified for funding under that designation, and thus were categoriezed according to their definitions. The downloadable dataset `data/university-classifications/2020-msi-eligibility-matrix-rutgers.xls` was our source for those institiuational names and classifications. 

### R1's 

High Research Activity (R1) schools in the USA were identified via [Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education](https://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/index.php) and the downloadable file used to filter R1 universities `data/university-classifications/carnegie-institutional-classification-data.xls` was used for those classifications. 

### Research Universities Canada

Given the vastly smaller number of research universities in Canada, we used the [Scimago Institution Rankings](https://www.scimagoir.com/) and the downloadable file used to filter for universities `data/university-classifications/scimago-institution-rankings-CAN.csv` was used to identify those schools.
