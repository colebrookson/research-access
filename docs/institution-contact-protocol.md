# Contact Protocol for Institutions

If you are emailing an institution, this document will serve as your primary guide on how to do so. To start off, ensure that you have access to the following resources: 

* The email address *research@alexandracddavis.com* 
* The university contact sheet: *Collated University Contact Data*
* The Gov/NGO contact sheet: *Collated Gov/NGO Contact Sheet*

Before you send any emails, look through the existing emails that have already been sent to get a handle on some common exchanges/questions/patterns that cases have displayed thus far. Also, look through the various stock emails (at the bottom of this document) to familiarize yourself with how we can respond to different cases. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## The Contact Process
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the purposes of this example, we'll refer to the process of contacting a single institution as a *case*. There are four main steps in the contact process: 

1. Initial Contact
2. Ongoing Liasing 
3. Data Acquisition
4. Case Conclusion

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1. Initial Contact
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* In either of the contact sheets, find the case you need to contact. All cases with `Status = 1` need to be actioned. For example, McGill University - identify the case in the contact sheet, and find the contact info: 

![Description \label{ContactInfo}](images/contact-info.png)

* Once you have found the contact info, navigate to the Gmail account and first check to ensure there hasn't already been any correspondence with this email (mistakes happen!)
* If there is no existing correspondance, begin a new message. Using the stock email for a first contact (found at the bottom of this doc), create a new message to this new contact and send out the email. 
    **Important Notes**

    - Always address emails to general addresses (i.e. *schulich.library@mcgill.ca*) as "*Hi there,*"
    - Always address emails to specific people by their last names (i.e. "*Dear Dr. Soandso,*"), and remember to double check spelling!! and even if you have reason to believe they're not a Doctorate, address them as Dr. - it's gender nuetral and doesn't assume a position lower than that they might have. They'll correct you if they would prefer; most people will just ask to be called by their first names. If they do, refer to them how they ask to be referred to 

![Description \label{Email}](images/email.png)

* Send emails in the MORNING always! If you are working at a different time, use the schedule send function via the "down" arrow beside the "Send" button, to schedule a time - **initial emails should always be sent on weekdays, and should be scheduled to go out at 7:49AM EST**

* Once the email is sent/scheduled, add a label with your name (as the `Cole-corresponds` example here)

* Change the contact sheet information with the relevant information:
    * The `Status` column should now read `6` which codes for "Waiting for Response"
    * Change the `Contacted?`, `Date Contacted` and `Contact Individual` columns to reflect the relevant information (note: contact individual is you)

First step done :)  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 2. Ongoing Liasing 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tends to be the longest part of the process. Typically about 50% of institutions will respond promptly (w/in 3-5 business days). 

If the given institution *does* respond, they will likely respond in one of three ways: 
1. They will agree to provide some type of help and may ask a few follow-up questions
2. They will decline any help, usually citing some capacity shortages
3. They will suggest they have limited capactiy to help, and will offer alternatives and/or ask for more details on what we need. 

Here is how to respond to each: 

#### Some Type of Help 

An ideal form of response in this case looks like this: 

```
Good Afternoon Mr. Brookson,

Thank you for reaching out to the US Geological Survey Library.

We would be happy to participate, depending on the level of information you are seeking and our ability to comply.

I've copied Tami Morse, our Cataloging Librarian, she can help with the technical aspects of mining our catalog.
```

In this case, our job is easy - simply respond in a timely fashion, clarifying what exactly we're looking for and attaching the list of ISSNs in the `.csv` file. 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 4. Case Conclusion 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* add that we need to set a new task for data cleaning 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Email Organization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## The Stock Emails
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Intial Email

* Change name as needed - use "Hi there" for general emails (i.e. no specific person)
* 

#### Subject: Request for Library Collections Information
```
Dear Dr. Soandso/Hi there,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm a graduate student at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, and along with my colleague Dr. Alexandra Davis, we're conducting a large-scale research project investigating access to published research in a subset of the biological sciences. 

We are currently in the process of identifying libraries at multiple institutions including universities, NGOs, and government agencies, with the goal of assessing the level of access to academic journals that these institutions provide to their researchers, instructors, practitioners, and students. 

I wonder if it would be possible to request an internal search of your library databases on a list of ISSNs we have that we're interested in via your link resolver? If this is something you'd be willing to help us with, I can send a csv we have prepared of the ~1300 ISSNs that we are interested in. On the chance that someone else in your library system might have more information on how we could proceed, any contact information you have would be much appreciated.

Please let me know if this is something that you would be able to help us with, and thank you for your time. 

All the best,
```

Our Response:

Hi Holly & Tami,

Thanks so much for getting back to me! That would be amazing. So essentially all  we really need in terms of information is, for each ISSN in our list, a) whether or not you have access, b) ideally the time you have access to the journal from (e.g. 1993-Present) and that's pretty much it. Would that be possible?

I've attached the list of ISSNs we're interested in here. Please let me know if there is any other information I can provide that would be helpful!

Thanks again!
Cole
