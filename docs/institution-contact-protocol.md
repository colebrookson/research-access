# Contact Protocol for Institutions

If you are emailing an institution, this document will serve as your primary guide on how to do so. To start off, ensure that you have access to the following resources: 

* The email address *research@alexandracddavis.com* 
* The university contact sheet: *Collated University Contact Data*
* The Gov/NGO contact sheet: *Collated Gov/NGO Contact Sheet*

## The Contact Process

For the purposes of this example, we'll refer to the process of contacting a single institution as a *case*. There are four main steps in the contact process: 

1. Initial Contact
2. Ongoing Liasing 
3. Data Acquisition
4. Case Conclusion

### 1. Initial Contact

In either of the contact sheets, find the case you need to contact. All cases with `Status = 1` need to be actioned. For example, McGill University - identify the case in the contact sheet, and find the contact info: 

Once you have found the contact info, navigate to the Gmail account and begin a new message. Using the stock email for a first contact (found at the bottom of this doc), create a new message to this new contact and send out the email. First step done :)
