# Contact Protocol for Institutions

If you are emailing an institution, this document will serve as your primary guide on how to do so. To start off, ensure that you have access to the following resources: 

* The email address *research@alexandracddavis.com* 
* The university contact sheet: *Collated University Contact Data*
* The Gov/NGO contact sheet: *Collated Gov/NGO Contact Sheet*

## The Contact Process

For the purposes of this example, we'll refer to the process of contacting a single institution as a *case*. There are four main steps in the contact process: 

1. Initial Contact
2. Ongoing Liasing 
3. Data Acquisition
4. Case Conclusion

### 1. Initial Contact

* In either of the contact sheets, find the case you need to contact. All cases with `Status = 1` need to be actioned. For example, McGill University - identify the case in the contact sheet, and find the contact info:

* Once you have found the contact info, navigate to the Gmail account and first check to ensure there hasn't already been any correspondence with this email (mistakes happen!)
* If there is no existing correspondance, begin a new message. Using the stock email for a first contact (found at the bottom of this doc), create a new message to this new contact and send out the email. 
    **Important Notes**

    - Always address emails to general addresses (i.e. *schulich.library@mcgill.ca*) as "*Hi there,*"
    - Always address emails to specific people by their last names (i.e. "*Dear Dr. Soandso,*"), and remember to double check spelling!! and even if you have reason to believe they're not a Doctorate, address them as Dr. - it's gender nuetral and doesn't assume a position lower than that they might have. They'll correct you if they would prefer; most people will just ask to be called by their first names. If they do, refer to them how they ask to be referred to

* Send emails in the MORNING always! If you are working at a different time, use the schedule send function via the "down" arrow beside the "Send" button, to schedule a time - **initial weekdays should always be sent on weekdays, and should be scheduled to go out at 7:49AM EST**
* Once the email is sent/scheduled, add a label with your name (as the `Cole-corresponds` example here)

First step done :)
