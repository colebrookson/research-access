# Access-to-Research

This repository stores the code and data files for the analysis pertaining to a global review and synthesis of the accessibility of academic papers and publications to managers working in the ecological sphere.

The goal of this review is to identify steps along the 'Publishing Pipeline' where the industry of academic publishing fails the end user by not providing access to the managers and on-the-ground conservation scientists who need it the most.
